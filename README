## Pure abstract  

Define the specifications of the cloud in term of ONLY pure atoms and classes, that is, do not use the actual implementations from jclouds for it.
Afterwards will try to make abstraction-concretization functions or some other mapping

To show case the specifications we implements a declarative jclouds provider


# Architecture

The STUB object receives the contributions or contains the following parts:

	- Cloud Model(s)
	
	- Abstraction/Concretization functions. Mapping between object model and concrete objects
	
	- Implements the INIT method in terms of app-specific objects that are managed by the Abstraction function
	
	- Exposes the required methods to interact with the cloud
	
In the first implementation the STUB instances are managed by a simple factory.
